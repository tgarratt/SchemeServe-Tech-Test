A task to display crime data based on a provided postcode.

I setup the React application to the best of my ability as if this was a project of my own.

I installed tailwind for the use of CSS.

Using `react-router-dom` I set up the pages for a fully functioning React application.

Using the provided APIs I set up a provider to handle the state, alowing for cleaner files in the future.

I used hooks and mutations to access several APIs and return the data to the relevent file.

My 2 hour timer went off here as I was concluding how to return the specific crime data.
